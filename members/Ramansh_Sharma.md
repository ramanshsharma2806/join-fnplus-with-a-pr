### About

I am a college freshman right now. I found computer science back in junior year of high school when I took the APCS Java course. Since then, I have realized that I want to work in Machine Learning/Deep Learning in the future. I am currently in the process of learning the aforementioned topics from Coursera courses (and am learning TensorFlow right now, so if you want to learn together, shoot me an email).

I yearn to work for SpaceX someday as it my dream to revolutionize deep space research with deep learning. The possibilities are literally and figuratively, endless!
